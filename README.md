## "CRASHCAM" - Pi5 Camera - ENCLOSURE/CAD

Hello everyone, this marks my first attempt at designing a compact, highly modular enclosure, utilizing the [**CinePi**](https://github.com/cinepi) project, to evaluate its suitability for my team's production needs.

**This work is still in progress and far from complete.**

The front plate (not the one showing here) was initially designed and made of aluminum (cnc), with a few extrusions that touch the CPU and memory of the Pi board for passive cooling and reduced vibrations.

# What's next...
- [ ] External case for the Hyperpixel 4, that can be mounted on top or the side of the camera body.
- [ ] A "DSLR" grip with buttons and maybe enough space for a battery, that can be mounted on right side of the camera body.

# Dimensions
- Width: `~100mm`
- Height: `86mm`
- Depth: `50mm`
