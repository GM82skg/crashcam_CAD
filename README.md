# "CRASHCAM" - Pi5 Camera ENCLOSURE/CAD

Hello, I am working in the commercial space, and this marks my first attempt to develop a compact "crashcam", utilizing the CinePi project, to evaluate its suitability for our production needs.

**This work is still in progress and far from complete.**

The front plate was initially designed and made of aluminum (CnC), with a few extrusions that touch the CPU and memory of the Pi board for passive cooling and reduced vibrations.
