# "CRASHCAM" - Pi5 Camera - ENCLOSURE/CAD

Hello, I am working in the commercial space, and this marks my first attempt to develop a compact, highly modular "crashcam" enclosure, utilizing the [**CinePi**](https://github.com/cinepi) project, to evaluate its suitability for our production needs.

**This work is still in progress and far from complete.**

The front plate (not the one showing here) was initially designed and made of aluminum (cnc), with a few extrusions that touch the CPU and memory of the Pi board for passive cooling and reduced vibrations.
